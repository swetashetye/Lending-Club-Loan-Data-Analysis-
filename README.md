# Lending-Club-Loan-Data-Analysis-
 We are expected to play with the data provided by LC, conduct a set of exploratory analysis and try to apply various machine learning techniques to predict whether or not a loan will be default using the historical data.

## Problem Statement:

For companies like Lending Club correctly predicting whether or not a loan will be a default is very important. In this project, using the historical data from 2007 to 2015, you have to build a deep learning model to predict the chance of default for future loans. As you will see later this dataset is highly imbalanced and includes a lot of features that make this problem more challenging.

A quick look at what the columns in the dataset represent:

1. credit.policy: 1 if the customer meets the credit underwriting criteria of LendingClub.com, and 0 otherwise.

2. purpose: The purpose of the loan (takes values "credit_card", "debt_consolidation", "educational", "major_purchase", "small_business", and "all_other").

3. int.rate: The interest rate of the loan, as a proportion (a rate of 11% would be stored as 0.11). Borrowers judged by LendingClub.com to be more risky are assigned higher interest rates.

4. installment: The monthly installments owed by the borrower if the loan is funded.

5. log.annual.inc: The natural log of the self-reported annual income of the borrower.

6. dti: The debt-to-income ratio of the borrower (amount of debt divided by annual income).

7. fico: The FICO credit score of the borrower.

8. days.with.cr.line: The number of days the borrower has had a credit line.

9. revol.bal: The borrower's revolving balance (amount unpaid at the end of the credit card billing cycle).
